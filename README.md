# Exception-Handling-Pytest-Raises
Supplemental activity for Exception Handling roundtable

## Activity Instructions
Fork and clone this repository.

Review the following:
1. The `claim_unreserved_code_school_name` function in `school_name.py`
1. The working tests in `tests/test_school_name_with_pytest_raises.py`
1. The `test_invalid_name_no_pytest` test in `tests/test_school_name_no_pytest_raises.py`
   
Implement the body of test_invalid_name_no_pytest.

DO NOT use `pytest.raises` or any other functionality from pytest. The challenge is to think through what `pytest.raises` is actually doing and to appreciate that we don't usually have to do it ourselves!
